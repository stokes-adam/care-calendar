This is a work-in-progress. I have plans to create two or three projects.

1. ***carecalendar.xyz.***  This will be the barebones product page which goes through what the product is about, who should use the product and what the uses are.
   
2. ****** ***booking.carecalendar.xyz.***  This is the app which recieptionists will use. This is considered to be the product.
   
3. *maybe* *****admin.carecalendar.xyz.***  This is the tool used by administrators or business owners who can manage users and permissions of the booking app.
