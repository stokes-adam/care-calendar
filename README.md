## The Repository

Pulumi is an Infrastructure as Code platform that allows you to build, deploy and manage cloud infrastructure. In this case, AWS is the cloud provider. The plan is to build a relatively simple SaaS model business product in it's entirety. That means from the on-the-ground programming to hosting the infrastructure and deploying changes.
